It looks like you’ve successfully installed Minikube, but you’re encountering a “command not found” issue. Let’s address this step by step:

Path Issue: The error message indicates that the minikube command is not found. This could be due to the location of the Minikube executable in your system.
Verify Path: First, let’s check if Minikube is in your system’s path. Run the following command:
which minikube
If it doesn’t return anything, we’ll need to adjust the path.
Move Minikube Executable: Since you’ve installed Minikube using Homebrew, it should be located in /usr/local/Cellar/minikube/1.5.2/bin/minikube. To make it accessible system-wide, move it to /usr/local/bin:
sudo mv /usr/local/Cellar/minikube/1.5.2/bin/minikube /usr/local/bin/

Verify Again: Now check if Minikube is in your path:
which minikube

Restart Terminal: Sometimes, restarting your terminal session is necessary for the changes to take effect. Close and reopen your terminal or run:
source ~/.bashrc

Test Minikube Version: Finally, verify that Minikube is working:
minikube version

This should resolve the “command not found” issue, and you’ll be able to use Minikube. Let me know if you encounter any further issues! 😊 12
